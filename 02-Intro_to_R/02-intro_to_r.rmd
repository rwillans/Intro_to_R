## Introduction

### Learning Objective

This second short intro session aims to cover

1. An introduction to RStudio projects
2. Importing data from csv files
2. The magrittr pipe
4. Manipulation of data with dplyr - select, filter, mutate, group_by, summarise verbs
5. Exporting csv files back to disk

### Course Philosophy

* Scheduling a time that works for everyone is a pain. We all have lots of teams meetings for other responsibility. I also want to maintaining compatibility with the current Python club format. Consequently, I will talk for less than 30 mins talking each session, allowing time for Q&A and most importantly practising writing code. 
* We start from the assumption of no familiarity with R, but will also try to take into account people"s background and interests and offer something for everyone. So if you"ve already some development experience, you should learn something new about R. Equally if you are starting from scratch sessions should not overwhelm you.
* I will point to further resources as we go. Most R resources are free or generously licensed. It"s perfectly possible to teach yourself to a high standard without spending any money on paid courses. I encourage you to browse signposted resources where you want more detail on a particular area. It"s also likely that you will find some resources that you like better than others, so if one resource does not work for you, move on and try another.
* Each session should allow attendees to come away having learnt how to at least one useful core R skill, maximising the usefulness of these sessions, and maintaining the motivation to learn. We do not want to spend hours on loading in, tidying and formatting data before we eventually get to some outputs.
* I strongly encourage attendees to practice with R outside of Python Club "in the day job". We will aim to cover things that you can use accordingly. I want to show you enough for you to teach yourself to do what you want to do, not show you everything.  

You can access these tutorial notes after the session for reference and self-directed learning, and also share these within NICE if desired. Sessions will (very) roughly follow the NHS-R network"s introduction to R course, and the R for Data Science book by Wickham and Grolemond (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Feedback on sessions will shape the content of future sessions.  

## RStudio Projects

* R Projects are a means of organising your work within R Studio
* You should create a separate R Project for each piece of work
* The essence of an R Project is that it provides
  1. A directory structure
  2. A "working directory", which is a filepath that R uses as a starting point for looking for files.
* Having a working directory means that you can write shorter, more reproducible code, like read_csv("filename.csv") rather than read_csv("C:\\Users\\BloggsJ\\Documents\\R\\some_incomprehensible_file_path_that_is_just_a_pain_to_keep_typing\filename.csv")
* You can think of it as an easy way of storing your work into folders
* To create a new project in Rstudio Cloud, just click the blue 'New Project' button after logging in. Everything is automatically organised into projects.

![](images/new_proj_rstudio_cloud.png)

* Within each project directory you can see your files in the bottom right window

![](images/projectfiles.png)



### Uploading a file to Rstudio Cloud

* To get a file into RStudio cloud or RStudio server, you can upload it via the "Upload" button in the files pane of the bottom right window. That should open a window to select the file, and it should be saved in the directory currently visible. 

![](images/Upload.png)

## Reading data with readr

* readr is a package for importing flat file data, including csv files. If you want to import excel files, these can be read with readxl package, or for STATA or SPSS files you can use the haven package. Today we are just going to look at reading csv files.

* readr functions are built using C++ internals, so tend to import data much faster than base R functions as well as having greater functionality. You should use readr functions rather than the base R read.csv function in almost all cases. Tidyverse versions of functions usually contain an underscore "_" rather than a dot, so the readr version is "read_csv", the base r version is "read.csv"

* read_csv (note the underscore) takes the filename (as string) in the first argument, so you can assign a read in file as follows

```{r readr, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

#If it's not installed already, install readr by running 
install.packages('readr')

#then load readr
library(readr)

#read in file from data subdirectory, and assign it to "df" 
df <- read_csv(file = "diamonds.csv")

```

* Alternatively, you can use the Rstudio import function, by clicking on a csv file in  the files window and selecting "Import Dataset".

![](images\import.png)

* This loads a nice interface which contains drop downs to select column types if you want to specify these manually, and will also generate the relevant code in the "code preview" box in the bottom right.

## Manipulating data with dplyr

### Overview

* The name comes from the ["split-ap*ply*-combine"](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01) paradigm by Hadley Wickham, which looks to split data into smaller pieces, perform operations on those pieces, then put them back together in the way you want.

* Dplyr allows you to manipulate dataframes with a *verb* syntax, so gives a very intuitive sense for what each function in the package does.

* The main verbs that we will cover today are
  + select (picks columns of interest)
  + filter (picks rows of interest)
  + mutate (creates new columns)
  + arrange (orders rows) 
  + group_by / summarise (groups rows and generates summary variables)    


* But before we dive into dplyr, we will cover the *magrittr pipe*

* Recently there has been a version of the pipe implemented in base R version 4.1, but we are just going to cover the magrittr version here.

### Pipes

* Pipes are an example of ["syntactic sugar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar), making R code easier to read and write.

* The most common version of the pipe in R is the [*magrittr*](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) pipe. The name comes from the [painting by the surrealist artist Rene Magritte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images). Originally a separate package, the magrittr pipe is now included in dplyr.

* The magrittr pipe is written as a ">" between two percentage "%" symbols -  "%>%" . Rstudio has a nice keyboard shortcut (control-shift-m). 

* The pipe sits between an object and a function, or two functions. It takes whatever precedes the pipe (the left hand side), and "pipes" it into the first argument for a function on the right hand side. This makes code more readable rather than nesting functions in functions, so you can read from left to right rather than right to left.


```{r pipe, eval = FALSE}

#These 2 expressions are equivalent
print("hello world")
"hello world" %>% print()


```


* It is possible to daisy-chain functions together using the pipe, so you can pass an object through several functions in one "line". In dplyr this normally takes the form of passing a dataframe through several dplyr verbs. Each function is joined up by a " %>% " pipe. For example:


```{r daisychain}

# Here we pass the diamonds dataset through select, filter, group_by and summarise functions.
# Do not worry about the contents of each function yet, though you may be able to tell what they are doing anyway

#how many diamonds have clarity SI2 or SI1? What is their mean price?
diamonds %>%
  select(clarity, price) %>% 
  filter(clarity == "SI1" | clarity == "SI2") %>% 
  group_by(clarity) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), av_price = mean(price))

```


* Breaking the line at %>% also makes the code more readable. R will understand that the operation is on multiple lines. 

* Now we will look at some common dplyr verbs....


### Select

* The select function returns an amended version of a dataframe with fewer columns. You might want to work with a subset of columns in a large dataframe, to keep things manageable and your code fast.

* Select takes an argument specifying the dataframe, either in the function or piped in, and then an argument specifying which columns to pick

* We"ll test this using the "starwars" dataframe, which is an inbuilt dataframe with details of star wars characters from the star wars api. We can take a look at the dataframe as follows

```{r staRwars}

starwars

```

* Let us say we are just interested in characters names, height, weight and species for now. To restrict the dataframe to these columns, we use select and pass in the column names we want:

```{r select}

starwars %>% 
  select(name, species, mass, height)
```

* You can also specify columns according to conditions, like select(is.numeric) to select all numeric columns, or select(contains("color")) would select all columns where the name contains "color, like the example below.

```{r select-contains}
starwars %>% 
  select(contains("color"))
```


### Filter

* As select allows us to remove **columns** we are not interested in, filter allows us to remove **rows** that we are not interested in.

* The syntax is similar, though typically we would pass in conditions rather than row numbers.

* To select characters who are 2 metres or taller, we would do this:

```{r filter}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
  filter(height >= 200)
```


### Mutate

* Mutate is the verb to create new columns. It is not as intuitively named as the others, admittedly. Typically you"ll use other columns to construct your new column variable.   

* In this case, we"ll use mass (in kg) and height (in cm) to construct a BMI value for each star wars character.

* Mutate takes the dataframe as first argument (here piped in) and then an argument to create the new column.

```{r mutate}
#NB - we filter to remove missing values by removing rows not greater than 0

starwars %>% 
  select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
  filter(height > 0 & mass > 0) %>% 
  mutate("BMI" = (mass/(height/100)^2))
```

* Presto! We now have BMI values for all Star Wars characters. 


### Arrange

* Arrange sorts the dataset according to values in specified columns.

* So to sort the star wars dataset by BMI (ascending), we would write:

```{r arrange}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
  filter(height > 0 & mass > 0) %>% 
  mutate("BMI" = (mass/(height/100)^2)) %>% 
  arrange(BMI)
```

* We can sort by values descending by wrapping the column in desc(). To sort by BMI **descending** would therefore be 

```{r arrange2, echo=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
  filter(height > 0 & mass > 0) %>% 
  mutate("BMI" = (mass/(height/100)^2)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(BMI))
```

* Unsurprisingly, Jabba the Hutt has the highest BMI of any Star Wars character. Yoda has the third highest BMI of 39, being 2.5 stone but only 66cm tall. R2-D2 similarly would be defined as obese with a BMI > 30.


### Group_by and Summarise

* Grouping a dataframe allows you to perform data operations by specified groups. It is most commonly used with "summarise" to create summary statistics for each group

* Summarise uses similar syntax to mutate, but will return results grouped by the variables in group_by. Summarise() or summarize() will do the same thing. As the tidyverse was created by New Zealander Hadley Wickham, British English spellings work.

* To see this in action, we"ll calculate the mean, maximum and minimum BMI values for each species

```{r groupby, echo=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
  filter(height > 0 & mass > 0) %>% 
  mutate("BMI" = (mass/(height/100)^2)) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise("mean_bmi" = mean(BMI))
```


## Writing files back to disk

* Once you have manipulated the dataframe, you may wish to save results back to disk as another csv file.

* Here the write_csv function is used. This takes the dataframe you wish to save as the first argument, and the filename as the second argument. E.g.

```{r filesave}

summary_df <- starwars %>%
  select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
  filter(height > 0 & mass > 0) %>% 
  mutate("BMI" = (mass/(height/100)^2)) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise("mean_bmi" = mean(BMI))

write_csv(summary_df, "summary_df.csv")

```

              random_answer_order = TRUE,
              allow_retry = TRUE))

```

11. Load up Rstudio, install dplyr (install.packages('dplyr')) and load it into your session (library(dplyr)). Can you write an expression using two piped dplyr verbs that returns the name and height columns, and Droid rows only, from the Starwars dataframe? You may have to think about the order in which you specify the relevant verbs.

```{r Q12_13, echo = FALSE}

quiz(question("Question 12: Which dplyr code creates a new column that is twice the height column?",
              answer("starwars %>% mutate(\"height_times_two\" = 2*height)", correct = TRUE),
              answer("starwars %>% mutate(\"2*height\" = height_times_two)", message = "the new variable goes first, followed by the definition"),
              answer("starwars %>% select(\"height_times_two\" = 2*height)"),
              answer("starwars %>% summarise(\"height_times_two\" = 2*height"),
              random_answer_order = TRUE,
              allow_retry = TRUE),
     question("Question 13: Which dplyr code returns the mean average height split by eye_color?",
              answer("starwars %>% group_by(eye_color) %>% summarise(\"mean_height\" = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)", correct = TRUE),
              answer("starwars %>% summarise(mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))"),
              answer("starwars %>% select(eye_color) %>% summarise(mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))"),
              answer("starwars %>% summarise(mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% group_by(eye_color)"),
              random_answer_order = TRUE,
              allow_retry = TRUE
              ))

```


14.  Can you filter the starwars dataset to rows where height >100?

15. Extending this query, find out who is the shortest character whose height is still >100 by re-arranging the dataset to order by height ascending

16. Using group_by and summarise, find out the mean average height of characters split by gender. Note that you will need to include the argument "na.rm = TRUE" in your mean function so it ignores missing data.

17. Amongst droids, which is the most common eye_color? You may want to lookup the 'n' function to use in your summarise verb.

18. Lookup the select help documentation with by typing ?select at the console. Can you use a helper function within select to return all rows of starwars where the skin_color contains "red"?

19. Create a new column of starwars calculating BMI for each character (see earlier notes). Can you pipe the resulting dataset into a histogram using ggplot and geom_histogram?

20. Group_by and summarise the data to create a summary statistic and grouping variable of your choice. Use a pipe to feed this into a ggplot bar graph


## Further Resources

#### R help files

Help and syntax for any particular function can be accessed by typing ? plus the function name into the console, e.g. ?data.frame. Searches of the help documentation can be run by typing a double question mark followed by the search term, e.g. ??object. Often this can solve specific queries fairly quickly.

#### Websites

Other specific error messages or questions can often be resolved by a search on [Google](www.google.co.uk) or [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) . There are also lots of tutorials and short videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=R+tutorials) if you know what you"re searching for. There is also a R specific search engine built on the back of google called [R-Seek](https://www.rseek.org) which does a good job of narrowing down and filtering to R content only. The [NHS-R community website](https://nhsrcommunity.com) also offers recordings, blogs and other R resources. Their slack channel is useful for queries and R related news. [R-bloggers](https://r-bloggers.com) also aggregates R blogs so can be useful to monitor or search for things of interest. [R weekly](https://rweekly.org) is a mailing list which gives you up to date developments with all things R.
